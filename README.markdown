# github.com.js

This is a github.com extension for dotjs <https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs/>, so go read up about that.

When you're done, dump this in your ~/.js/ directory. Oh and don't forget to replace "**" in github.com.js with your username / api token. 

When all that nonsense is done, a `Projects` link will appear next to the `Dashboard` link in the menu at the top of `GitHub.com`. When you 
hover over that link you'll see a list of your personal repositories and a list of repositories in all the organizations you belong to. 

Enjoy.
