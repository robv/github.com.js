# github.com.js

I got really tired of context switching as I use GitHub both personally and for work. This is a GitHub.com for dotjs https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs/ so go read up about that, and then dump this in your ~/.js/ directory. Oh and don't forget to replace "**" in github.com.js with your username / api token. Enjoy.
